10.) Write C program to blink LED connected to 1st pin of PORTC with appropriate delay.

#define led_pin 8 
void setup() {  
pinMode(led_pin, OUTPUT); 
} 
void loop() { 
digitalWrite(led_pin, HIGH);
delay(1000);
digitalWrite(led_pin, LOW);
delay(1000);
}

3 Add an LED on pin 8 (only needed if you keep led_pin 8)
Click ADD PART (left toolbar), choose LED and Resistor (220 Ω).

Drag the LED so its anode (label A) sits on digital pin 8 of the UNO, and its cathode (label C) on one end of the resistor.

Connect the other end of the resistor to GND.
The wiring is the same as on a breadboard – Wokwi auto-colors the lines so it’s easy to see.

Press Save.

4 Run the simulation
Click the green ► Run button.

If you used pin 13: the little “L” LED on the UNO board blinks.

If you wired an external LED to pin 8: that LED will fade from black (OFF) to bright red (ON) every second.

You can pause/rewind the simulation at any time, or open “Logic Analyzer” (top-right “+” menu) and hook channel 0 to D8 to see a perfect 1 s square-wave.

5 Troubleshooting tips
Symptom	Quick check
LED always dark	Is the resistor really tied to GND? Is led_pin the same number the LED is connected to?
Compiler error says “unknown board”	Make sure the project template is Arduino UNO (or change the board in the dropdown next to Run).
LED blinks too fast/slow	You changed the delay() values or simulation speed slider (bottom bar).

6.) Write ALP program to monitor the bit 1 of PORTC. If set send ‘Y’ to PORTA else 
send ‘N’ to PORTB.

O/P:-


5 Drive pin PC1 in the I/O window
Open the I/O window
Debug ▸ Windows ▸ I/O → expand PORTC.

Edit the “PIN” value (double-click the value column or right-click ▸ Set Value).

Set PC1 = 1 (write 0x02) if you want the “Y” path.

Set PC1 = 0 (write 0x00) if you want the “N” path.

Only bit 1 matters; other bits may stay 0.

6 Run to the decision point
Fast way – set a breakpoint on ldi r16,'Y' (or on over:) and press F5.
The simulator stops on whichever branch is taken.

Single-step way – keep pressing F10 until you reach out PORTA,r16 or out PORTB,r16.

7 Watch the result
Window	Path	What you’ll see
Registers	Debug ▸ Windows ▸ Registers	R16 = 0x59 (“Y”) or 0x4E (“N”)
I/O → PORTA	already open	Data = 0x59 if “Y” branch
I/O → PORTB	already open	Data = 0x4E if “N” branch
Watch (optional)	Alt + F9, W; add PORTA or PORTB	live view

(Right-click a Data field → Format ▸ ASCII to see the letter instead of hex.)

What just happened?
All pins start as outputs (DDRx = 0xFF).

cbi DDRC,1 turns PC1 into an input, leaving the other PC pins as outputs.

SBIS PINC,1 examines that input once:

PC1 = 1 → skip the rjmp over → drop into “Y” path → PORTA = 'Y'.

PC1 = 0 → execute rjmp over → drop into “N” path → PORTB = 'N'.

The endless loop keeps the result stable so you can read it.

To test the other branch, just:

Change the PINC value (toggle bit 1).

Press Ctrl + Shift + F5 to restart debugging.

F5 to run again.

Common hiccups
Symptom	Cause	Fix
Can’t edit PINC	PC1 is still configured as an output	Make sure the cbi DDRC,1 line executes before you edit PINC.
Both PORTA & PORTB stay 0x00	Didn’t run past the branch	Put a breakpoint after each out or keep stepping.
Wrong port shows a value	Remember: “Y” → PORTA, “N” → PORTB.

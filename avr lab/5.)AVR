5.)Write ALP program to accept two 8 bit numbers from PORTA and POTRB. 
Multiply two numbers and send the result to PORTC (lower byte) and PORTD (higher byte).

O/P:-
5 Drive the input pins (PINA / PINB)
Because DDRA/DDR B were cleared, pins A & B are inputs: you must tell the simulator what external logic levels they “see”.

Open the I/O window
Debug ▸ Windows ▸ I/O → expand PORTA and PORTB.

Set the pin values
In the “PIN” column type the operand bytes:

Register	Value	Meaning
PINA	0x45	0100 0101₂ (69)
PINB	0x20	0010 0000₂ (32)

Click the value field (or right-click ▸ Set Value).
In older Studio versions the edit is in hex by default.

6 Run to the port-output lines
Fast way:

Set a breakpoint on out PORTC, r0 (click left gutter).

Press F5. The simulator stops just before the write.

Single-step way: keep hitting F10 until the yellow arrow reaches the out instructions.

7 See the multiplication result
Window	Open via	What you’ll read
Registers	Debug ▸ Windows ▸ Registers	R0 = 0xA0, R1 = 0x08
I/O → PORTC	Already open	Data = 0xA0
I/O → PORTD	Already open	Data = 0x08
Watch (optional)	Alt + F9, W then add R0, R1	Live view

Interpretation:
0x45 × 0x20 = 0x08A0 (2224 decimal)
• Low byte = A0 → goes to PORTC
• High byte = 08 → goes to PORTD

If you prefer decimal, right-click the I/O value → Format ▸ Unsigned Decimal.

8 Common hiccups & quick fixes
Symptom	Cause	Fix
PORTC/PORTD stay 00	Forgot to edit PINA / PINB	Enter the hex values in the I/O window before you hit the mul
Pins don’t accept edits	DDRA/DDR B not cleared	Make sure the two out DDRx, 0x00 lines are present before in r24,pina / in r25,pinb
Simulator starts at address 0	Missing rjmp reset	Keep the .cseg / reset vector lines

Want to test different numbers?
Just change the PINA and PINB “PIN” fields in the I/O window, then:

Press Ctrl + Shift + F5 (Restart debug session)

F5 to run to the breakpoint again

The new product appears instantly on PORTC/D.

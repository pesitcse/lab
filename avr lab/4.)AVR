O/P:-
5 ️⃣ Run to the point of interest
Quickest path
Set a breakpoint on out PORTA, r18 (click the left gutter).
Press F5.
Execution stops right before the port write.

Single-step path
Keep hitting F10 until the yellow arrow reaches out PORTA, r18.

6 ️⃣ Look at the result
Window	Menu path	What you’ll see
Registers	Debug ▸ Windows ▸ Registers	R18 = 0x78 (120 dec)
I/O View	Debug ▸ Windows ▸ I/O	Expand PORTA: Data = 0x78
Memory (optional)	Debug ▸ Windows ▸ Memory ▸ Memory1 → type &PORTA	Byte reads 78
Watch	Alt + F9, W then add R18	Live R18 updates while stepping

(If the I/O window shows hex but you prefer decimal: right-click → Format ▸ Unsigned Decimal.)

7 ️⃣ Why the answer is 0x78

Product   n
 1        5   (init)
 5        4
20       3
60       2
120      1  ← loop exits (r19 decrements to 0)
120 decimal = 0x78 hex, fits in one byte, so mul’s low byte (R0) is all you need.

(Factorials of 6 or more overflow 8 bits; you'd need 16-bit math then.)

Common pitfalls & fixes
Symptom	Likely cause	Fix
Simulator crashes at call	SP not initialised	Keep the SP setup lines
R18 shows 00	Broke before call fact finished	Step/run until after the subroutine
PORTA still FF	Forgot to set DDRA first	Leave ldi r16,0xFF / out DDRA,r16 in place
Need to test on real MCU	Connect your ISP/UPDI tool and change the Tool back to it, then Build → Program
